  <h2>100 Days of Code Challenge</h2>
  <p><I>3rd April</I></p>
  <ul><h3>Today's Progress:</h3></ul>
  <li>I finished the project of making a CSS flexbox by making a photo gallery</li>
  <li>I started a new project of making a nutrition label to learn typography</li>
  <ul><h3>Thoughts:</h3></ul>
  <li>I'm excited to begin the 100 days of code challenge, I started coding initially on the 21st of March, and it's been 13 
  days since. So far, I've learnt about html and CSS in freecodecamp, and I'm trying to get my first certificate which is the 
  Responsive Web Design certificate. I feel like aiming for an hour a day should be manageable in contrary to coding for more than
  5 hours in a day.</li>
