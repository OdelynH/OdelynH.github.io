        <h3>100 Days of Code (Day 1)</h3>
        <p><i>April 3rd, 2024</i></p>
        <p>Today's progress</p>
          <li>I finished the project of making a CSS flexbox by making a photo gallery</li>
          <li>I started a new project of making a nutrition label to learn typography</li>
          <li>I organized my Github repositories and worked on my personal portfolio</li>
        <h3>My thoughts:</h3>
        <p>I'm excited to begin the 100 days of code challenge, I started coding initially on the 21st of March, and it's been 13 
  days since. So far, I've learnt about html and CSS in freecodecamp, and I'm trying to get my first certificate which is the 
  Responsive Web Design certificate. I feel like aiming for an hour a day should be manageable in contrary to coding for more than
  5 hours in a day.</p>

        <h3>100 Days of Code (Day 2)</h3>
        <p><i>April 4th, 2024</i></p>
        <p>Today's progress</p>
        <li>I continued making the nutrition label to learn typography through CSS</li>
        <li>I started a tribute page on Yoasobi</li>
        <h3>My thoughts:</h3>
        <p>My progress is slow but steady, I'm still further deepening my knowledge on html and CSS. The key takeaways I learnt 
        today is that typography is also more complex than I initially thought, but I will keep studying it until I'm able to 
        make good web design when I master it.</p>

        <h3>100 Days of Code (Day 3)</h3>
        <p><i>April 5th, 2024</i></p>
        <p>Today's Progress:</p>
        <li>I focused on finishing the Yoasobi tribute page (And I did!)</li>
        <li>I started watching a CS50 Lecture on Understanding Technology to learn some theory</li>
        <h3>My thoughts:</h3>
        <p>Today, my motivation to code isn't that high but what matters isn't really motivation but the drive and consistency to code everyday,
            therefore I decided to take a different approach today and instead of forcing myself to work through the Nutrition label
        using CSS typography, I switched it up by taking an EdX class on Harvard's CS50 Understanding Technology.I 
        learnt how binary works when inputting numbers and letters. Overall, I found the lecture interesting and will continue to
        watch it tomorrow.</p>
