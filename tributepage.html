<ul id="tribute-info">Here's a timeline of YOASOBI's music career:
  <li>2019–2021: Formation, "Yoru ni Kakeru" and The Book</li>
  <p>Yoasobi is a pop duo formed by Sony Music Entertainment Japan. It is composed of Vocaloid producer Ayase and singer-songwriter Lilas Ikuta. Their goal is to turn "novel into music" and they did so with most of their songs. Their first song, "Yoru ni Kakeru" turned into a big hit during Covid-19 times in Japan. Following their debut single, Yoasobi released "Ano Yume o Nazotte" on January 18, 2020. In the second half of the year, they continually released three more singles. All of these originated from Novels. 
  <li>2021: The Book 2</li>
  <p>First announced in late 2020, Yoasobi recorded both the opening and ending themes for the second season of the Japanese anime series Beastars. They started getting more and more popular. Furthermore, in 2021,Yoasobi began exploring English-language songs by translating from the original Japanese. The first song, "Into the Night", was released on July 2, translated by Konnie Aoki from "Yoru ni Kakeru". Yoasobi got awards that year and according to Oricon, the duo was the seventh best-selling artist in Japan in 2021, grossing ¥6.07 billion.
  <li>2022–2023: Hajimete no, "Idol" and The Book 3</li>
  <p>Yoasobi performed overseas for the first time in December 2022 at the Head in the Clouds Festival in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Manila, the Philippines. In 2023, Yoasobi was in charge of the opening theme of the anime series Oshi no Ko, titled "Idol". It got to the billboard Japan top 100 charts, which stayed in the charts for 22 non-consecutive weeks.
